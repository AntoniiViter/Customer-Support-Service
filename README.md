# Customer-Support-Service
I’ve recently learned and refined many fascinating concepts in the software engineering field, such as gRPC, Unit/Mock/Integration Testing, MVC, REST, various design patterns, SpringBoot, proper Git workflows, build systems, and Continuous Integration. Now, I’m eager to apply this knowledge, along with my experience from hackathons and other projects, to build something substantial.

Whether it’s a personal project or a corporate initiative, I’m excited to get started. My next endeavor will be developing a customer support platform with a built-in customizable GPT model and other features commonly found in such services.

I’m ready to put this knowledge into practice and create something impactful!
